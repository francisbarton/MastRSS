# MastRSS
Trying to build a Python app that turns a Mastodon user profile into an RSS feed.

The intention is to run a hosted script that will ask the user for the address of the instance, and the ID of the desired user.
The script will use the Mastodon API to get the specified user's toots and serve them as an RSS feed.

The RSS feed can then be piped to IFTTT or similar.
